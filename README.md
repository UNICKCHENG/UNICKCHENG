### Starting with an interesting project , let's make everything possible


![Anurag's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats-uk.vercel.app/api?username=UNICKCHENG&show_icons=true)

I'm using [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/UNICKCHENG?tab=packages) to publish some open source packages üì¶, like docker images, maven packages.

For maven packages, if you don't find them in the [Maven central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.unickcheng), you can use my open GitHub repository mirror. Simply, you need to add the following repository information to successfully download the appropriate dependencies.

```xml
<!-- Add the GitHub repository address -->
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>unickcheng</id>
        <url>https://unickcheng.github.io/maven-packages/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

For open source projects, I'll provide the [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) startup files as much as possible so you don't have to redeploy the environment locally.  **If you are interested in some projects, welcome to incubate together üëè**.

If some of the projects helped you, feel free to support me by using the following
